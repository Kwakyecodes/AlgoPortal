Not trynna brag, but I know a ton of algorithms. 
Just hit me up with an algorithm you want and I'll spit it for you. 
Run /help to learn how to use me."""
HELP_INFO = """I can help you find any algorithm you want in your language of choice (actually, there is a limit on the languages but I'm positive you'll choose something I know).

To find a solution or algorithm, send me a message in this format: "the_name_of_algorithm_or_problem" language implementation.
For example: "Bubble sort" Java implementation.
Another example: "Reversing a linked list" Python3 implementation.

A little secret about me: I actually don't know all those algorithms by heart, but I'm very good at finding them on the internet * cough cough * ~GeeksforGeeks~ ^__^
